**ascon_kat_vectors** is a python package which provides a handy interface to a KAT file generated by the [reference Ascon implementation](https://github.com/ascon/ascon-c).
The KAT file for the Ascon128 algorithm included in this package can be found at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ascon/ascon-c/refs/tags/v1.2.7/crypto_aead/ascon128v12/LWC_AEAD_KAT_128_128.txt>.

## Installation

The package can be installed with pip:

```
git clone ascon_kat_vectors
cd ascon_kat_vectors
python -m pip install .
```

## Getting started

Retrieve a single vector:

```python
import ascon_kat_vectors

vec = ascon_kat_vectors.get(23)
print(vec)
```

Iterate over a random subset of vectors:

```python
import ascon_kat_vectors

for vec in ascon_kat_vectors.select(ad_size=1, k=10):
    print(vec)
```

Iterate over the whole database of vectors:

```python
import ascon_kat_vectors

for vec in ascon_kat_vectors.select():
    print(vec)
```
